# Configuring SSE plugins in Qlik

## Qlik Sense
You must configure SSE plugins, referred to by Qlik as analytic connections, in the Qlik Management Console (QMC) or using the Qlik Repository Service API. After you add a new analytic connection, you must restart the Qlik engine. 

For an overview of analytic connections, see __Analytic connections__ in the Qlik Sense Developers help:

## QlikView

You must configure SSE plugins, referred to by Qlik as analytic connections, by editing the settings.ini file (either for QlikView Server or QlikView Desktop). After you add a new analytic connection, you must restart QlikView.
